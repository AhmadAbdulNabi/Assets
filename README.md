# Assets Management System

This project is an ASP.NET MVC-based accounting system for managing assets.

## Database

The `Data` folder contains the SQL script or backup file required to create and initialize the database.  
You can find either a `.sql` script or a `.bak` backup file inside that folder. 

> **Note**: Make sure SQL Server has the proper permissions to access the `Data` folder, or move the `.bak` file to the default backup directory.
